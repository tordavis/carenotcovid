I'll list my relevant experiences. (1) No hospital-wide mandate for either staff or patients. (2) Almost nobody masks, neither staff nor patients, as of summer 2024. (3) For in-person appointments, when I check in, I am sometimes (but not always) asked if I have a preference for my provider to be masked vs unmasked. I always say masked. This request has virtually never been honored. It got to the point where I had to finally tell the receptionist that I am high risk, that my provider has not once worn a mask for me, and I NEED them to do something about it. That day he FINALLY wore a mask...but it was a surgical mask. This was in the dermatology department. (4) I had a PCP appointment in December 2023. She came into my room wearing a surgical mask. Then, WHILE ALREADY REMOVING HER MASK, she asked, ""Do you mind if I take this off?"" This was Dr. Rebecca Weiss-Coleman in internal medicine. She also did not seem to believe that I had long COVID, minimized my fears about contracting COVID again, and recommended that I exercise as much as I can despite my reporting clear symptoms of ME/CFS triggered by COVID. (5) The only department in which I have encountered a mask requirement is the infectious diseases department of the long COVID clinic. This does NOT include the entire long COVID clinic...literally just the infectious diseases department. All clinical staff, non-clinical staff, and patients are required to wear masks. However, they were once again all surgical masks. (6) Many clinical staff in other departments of the long COVID clinic did wear surgical masks, even without a requirement to do so. (7) I have not seen a single N95, KN95, or other similar high-quality respirator for the entire duration of the pandemic at NWMH. Maybe a patient here or there will be wearing one, but not one single staff member.","Proceedure/Surgical - ""baggy blues"", Not Applicable - no masks",,False,False,True,True,False

However, there are only 2 front desk staff present at a time, and there is an air purifier in the lobby. Patients are not required to mask in the waiting room. I have only ever encountered 2 other people max at a time in the waiting area. Each patient gets dental work done in their own room. The rooms do not have doors; however, each individual room has an industrial air purifier positioned in the doorway. They also allowed me to hold my personal air purifier on my lap the entire time as an extra precaution. They will also go out of their way to schedule you first thing in the morning if you want, to avoid any aerosol buildup throughout the day. Molar City has a lot of COVID cautious patients, and they are very used to treating patients with a lot of anxiety around COVID. They have been extremely understanding and not at all condescending.
